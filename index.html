    <!--we have different types of display properties namely;
        Block
        inline
        Block-inline
        None 
        Block elements takes the full with of the page, by BLOCKING other elements from 
        being on the same line with them. That's why they are called Block. we use the 
        span tag to style it
        eg <p> <h1>to<h6> <div> list items ul, ol li and forms
        Inline, takes as much space needed, they don't block other
        elements from appearing on the same line, That's why it's inline eg. Span, img and <a>

            <h3>Tech Foundational Skills</h3>
            <p>I started my tech journey when i was doing my industrial training attachment. I had always been caught between
                doing programming and networking. I did a ccna course after nysc, but i didn't get to write the international
                exams which cost a fortune to me back then cos i was sponsoring myself for the course.I started coding 
                in my first job after school, html, css and javascript. But i didn't take it serious until now. These are my
                foundation in IT.

            <h3>Food Preference</h3>
            <p>I love Egusi soup and pounded yam. When i was little, i had a believe that 
            all soups emanated from egusi soup. i grew up loving egusi soup along side beans and anything like
        garri, platain, bread, yam, rice etc..</p>
